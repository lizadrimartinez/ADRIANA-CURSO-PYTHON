    <h2> LIZBETH ADRIANA MARTINEZ HERNANDEZ </h2>

        <p> Hello , I'm ADRIANA MARTINEZ , call me ADRI please, I have 26 years on the church, 
        I baptized when was 18 years, You can count now  =), I'm single,
        I have 2  teenagers. I encouraged   my oldest son to take Pathwayv as well,
         I'm excited about this course, I'm learning about HTML again. 
        My job is programming in .net , VFOX ,SQL, in the statee government of TAMAULIPAS MEXICO.
         I worked here for a year before the mission.
        When I finished my mission I had the opportunity to work on the same place, for me it was a blessing. 
        A challenge that I had in  my job was a project to change the systems on a new lenguage. 
        Working with the systems and programming  in another language  at the same time was a challenge for me.
        But I always have blessings from our Heavenly Father, people who help me comply, my colleaguess were
        patients with me. Now  I just need their help with this,a few times.
        I have never worked in web programming, but I want to learn because is in high demand and I want to
        learn a lot more. My goal is to finish the first certificcate, but I hope to get my Bachelor's Degree,
        it doesn't matter if I get it until  I'm old woman.
        </p>
